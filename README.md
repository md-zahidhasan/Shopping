# Retail Trends & Profitability Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
